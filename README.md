# Synopsis
All-in-one business, resource, and project management tool

# Description
 - Intention: Create an open-source standalone/deployable all-in-one business, resource, and project management application. This reduces business costs, reduces management overhead, and provides transparency to project contributors. While solutions similar to our goal exist, none were open source, and none provided full-scope management from an entire business down to a single project.
 - Requirements:
   - Useable standalone or deployed as web app on remote server.
   - Highly configurable/modular per synopsis
   - Easy to use, maintain, and develop
